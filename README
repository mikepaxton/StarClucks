Automated Chicken Coop Door Controller

The coopdoor.py script uses Astral and Scheduler to automate the opening and closing of the chicken coop door.

A Raspberry Pi is being used to control an L289 H-Bridge motor controller which in turn is controlling
a 20" linear actuator.

The script can be modified to work at any location world wide by changing the location which Astral uses.
The last portion of the location, elevation can be omitted but provides an even more accurate calculation of
sunrise and dusk.
    # astral.Location format is: City, Country, Long, Lat, Time Zone, elevation
    loc = astral.Location(('lincoln city', 'USA', 45.0216, -123.9399, 'US/Pacific', 390))

GPIO push buttons have been added in addition to automatically open and closing the coop door.

The H-Bridge is controlled using GPIO pins 14 (open) and 15 (close).  The buttons use pins 18 (open) and 23 (close).

The following python modules will need to be installed on the Raspberry Pi:
gpiozero
schedule
astral
