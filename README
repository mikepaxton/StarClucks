Automated Chicken Coop Door and Control Panel

The coopdoor.py script uses Astral and Scheduler to automate the opening and closing of the chicken coop door.

The control.py script is used.....

The following python modules will need to be installed on the Raspberry Pi:

gpiozero
schedule
astral
adafruit-circuitpython-am2320
adafruit-circuitpython-ina260
i2c_lcd_driver

Please refer to the Wiki page for details on setting the hardware up.
For the wiring between the Raspberry Pi and the control panel I used a 18" piece of cat 6 ethernet cable.
The ethernet cable is used for all of the buttons, LCD and sensors inside of the control panel.
I use a separate pair of wires for the 5 volts need inside of the panel.
